  <h1>Our Policy</h1>
  <div>
      <h2>Immigration</h2>
      <p>
          NZ Seventh loves immigrants! That’s why, if elected, we introduce sweeping immigration reform. 
          Legislation will be introduced including the following modifications:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              Immigrants will be vetted on merit of their bungee-jumping skills and ability to articulate 
              why Western society is superior to all other societal models. 
              Failure in these tests would result in immediate deportation!
          </li>
          <li>
              New migrants have a run-up period (2 years) before gaining citizenship. 
              During this period these “people” may be hunted as legal game.
          </li>
          <li>
              Citizenship, when acquired, will be specially tailored to foreigners. 
              This will include a more specialised list of country visas, including only the <i>best</i> allied states.
      </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h2>Environment</h2>
      <p>
          NZ Seventh believes in the environment. It most certainly exists! 
          If we get into government, we will form a special committee to verify the environment’s existence. 
          We will also investigate options for implementing the words “environment”, “renewables”, and “climate change” in speeches. 
          We are committed to appearing to care about environmental issues, and unlike the major national parties, will not clutter 
          our beliefs with cumbersome policy.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h2>Housing</h2>
      <p>
          In recent months there has been masses of unfounded hysteria over a “housing crisis”. 
          This is a prime example of “fake news”, and it is seriously damaging the economy. 
          NZ Seventh will take inspiration from Orwell’s 1984 and enlist a newly created Ministry of Truth to expunge all mentions 
          of “housing crisis” from the record. Mentioning it will also become a crime (as an amendment to the Crimes Act).
      </p>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h2>Foreign Affairs</h2>
      <p>
          New Zealand Seventh pledges to hold a referendum to see if the consensus among the New Zealand population is in 
          favour of becoming an overseas territory of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
          Joining of a superior economy will be beneficial to both New Zealand and Great Britain.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h2>Health</h2>
      <p>
          Healthcare is vitally important to the running of our country. For too long, the Government has domineered over 
          the health sector, stifling industry and innovation. How can we solve this problem? The free market has worked 
          for so much else - why not health? Privatising the health industry will let companies innovate. We will also remove 
          monopoly restrictions on health businesses, meaning that companies can consolidate and drive prices up for the 
          common citizen. This will create more wealth and more jobs.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h2>Taxes</h2>
      <p>
          Taxes, taxes taxes! We promise to increase taxes for the first 2 tax brackets and decrease it for the 3rd and 4th 
          to discourage being poor! Adițional effects would be:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Incentivizing more rich people to migrate into New Zealand due to lower taxes- as well as disincentivize poor 
              people from immigrating and as a result- increase the economy.</li>
          <li>Allow us to sell the health system to private companies as there will be more rich people that can afford it - 
              creating more jobs and a bigger economy!</li>
          <li>Allow us to re-open the Pike River mines with no safety checks quickly since we are receiving more taxes from 
              poorer people, and it only seems moral to spend those taxes to re-open the Pike River mines. 
              This will create more happy citizens and once more - a larger economy.</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
          The education system has been approached entirely wrong, in fact, NZ seventh pledges to reform the education 
          system, to better prepare our children for the world of today. This will be done by segregating the schools; why 
          should our children be distracted by members of the opposite sex, this will inhibit their learning and will not 
          properly prepare them for real life. In addition, they will also be segregated by skin tone, allowing all students 
          to mix with similar people. Lastly, state schools will become property of the Anglican church, taking the strain of 
          education off the government, allowing more important things to be done with the budget.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h2>Economy</h2>
      <p>
          The economy is obviously a multifaceted issue. NZ Seventh will make sure we target all 3 facets.
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>MPs will have their wages inflated 500% - this will make them more accountable, 
              as they will want the job more.</li>
          <li>Introduce a asset rotation plan, whereby government assets are sold to private 
              investors and then bought again, repeatedly. This will keep things fresh.</li>
          <li>Introduce an education trading market, whereby NCEA credits can be exchanged for currency.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          This will solve every single problem that has ever plagued the economy, 
          and the Minister of Finance will be renamed Minister of Perpetual Sustainability.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h2>Treaty of Maori Supremacy</h2>
      <p>
          The Treaty of “Waitangi” (Maori Supremacy) is a perverse document, which gives Maoris five times the vote of Pakeha,
          and ability to buy land for half the price. This treaty has enabled the Maori party to gain vast majorities in 
          Parliament - under shell parties such as “National” and “Labour”, which claim to be decent Caucasian parties. 
          If we get into power, we will pass a Reversal of Waitangi Bill. This legislation will:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Officially undo all the changes made by the Treaty of Waitangi.</li>
          <li>Repair the damage done by the Treaty by requisitioning land - 
              this will be achieved by reigniting the Maori Land wars.</li>
          <li>Rituallly burn all original copies of the Treaty using kerosene and firelighters.</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h2>Welfare</h2>
      <p>
          Welfare is important to New Zealanders - it ensures that they're under the impression that poor people are being 
          helped. Unfortunately, welfare has grown into a governmental juggernaut, with taxpayer money significantly 
          contributing. The most logical decision is to restructure welfare programs as a state owned corporation - 
          individuals will have shares inversely proportional to their wealth. This means the total number of shares will 
          constantly refactored; the more poor people, the less money they get. We will also bestow upon this corporation - 
          The For-Profit Organisation for the Relative Betterment of Certain Peoples - the ability to deport welfare 
          fraudsters, as in defrauding the government they committed treason. We have decided against capital punishment 
          for this crime, as it would require pushing through convoluted legislation.
