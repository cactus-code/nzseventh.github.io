        <h2> Immigration </h2>
        <p>
            We love immigrants! That's why, if elected, we will make sure
            we get the best ones. Far form being homophobic, we <i>support</i>
            a homogenous society.
        </p>
        <p>
            Immigrants will be selected based on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bungee-jumping ability</li>
            <li>Ability to articulate why Western democracy is the
            best societal model</li>
            <li>Religious belief, or, of course, secular belief
                <i>in</i> religous belief</li>
            <li>Proficiency using Edmonds recipes</li>
            <li>Enjoyment of Pavlova, and belief in its origin in
                New Zealand</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These criteria will be tested using an NCEA-derived exam, and
            failure to meet them will result in immediate deportation.
        </p>
            New immigrants will have to undergo a short (2 years) run-up period
            before offical residency. During this time they may be hunted as
            game.
        <p>
            We will also provide a second tier of citizenship for new citizens,
            specially tailored towards their needs. Notable differences will
            include:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A customised passport with visas for only the
                    essentail foreign states</li>
                <li>A special "Good foreigner" badge</li>
                <li>No cumbersome welfare - they made it here, didn't they?</i>
            </ul>

        <h2> The Environment </h2>
        <p>
            NZ Seventh believes in the environment. It most likely exists!
            If we get into government, we will form a special committee to
            verify the environment’s existence. We will also investigate
            options for implementing the words “environment”, “renewables”,
            and “climate change” in speeches. We are committed to appearing
            to care about environmental issues, and unlike the major
            national parties, will not clutter our beliefs with
            cumbersome policy.
