        <h2>Immigration</h2>
        <p>
            We love immigrants! That's why, if elected, we will make sure
            we get the best ones. Far form being homophobic, we <i>support</i>
            a homogenous society.

            Immigrants will be selected based on:
            <ul>
                <li>Bungee-jumping ability</li>
                <li>Ability to articulate why Western democracy is the
                best societal model</li>
                <li>Religious belief, or, of course, secular belief <i>in</i> religous belief</li>
                <li>Proficiency using Edmonds recipes</li>
                <li>Enjoyment of Pavlova, and belief in its origin in New Zealand</li>
            </ul>
            These criteria will be tested using an NCEA-derived exam, and
            failure to meet them will result in immediate deportation.

            New immigrants will have to undergo a short (2 years) run-up period
            before offical residency. During this time they may be hunted as
            game.

            We will also provide a second tier of citizenship for new citizens,
            specially tailored towards their needs. Notable differences will include:
            <ul>
                <li>A customised passport with visas for only the essentail foreign states</li>
                <li>A special "Good foreigner" badge</li>
                <li>No cumbersome welfare - they made it here, didn't they?</i>
            </ul>
