  <h1>Our Policy</h1>
  <div>
      <h2>Immigration</h2>
      <p>
          NZ Seventh loves immigrants! That’s why, if elected, we introduce sweeping immigration reform. 
          Legislation will be introduced including the following modifications:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              Immigrants will be vetted on merit of their bungee-jumping skills and ability to articulate 
              why Western society is superior to all other societal models. 
              Failure in these tests would result in immediate deportation!
          </li>
          <li>
              New migrants have a run-up period (2 years) before gaining citizenship. 
              During this period these “people” may be hunted as legal game.
          </li>
          <li>
              Citizenship, when acquired, will be specially tailored to foreigners. 
              This will include a more specialised list of country visas, including only the best allied states.
      </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h2>Environment</h2>
      <p>
          NZ Seventh believes in the environment. It most certainly exists! 
          If we get into government, we will form a special committee to verify the environment’s existence. 
          We will also investigate options for implementing the words “environment”, “renewables”, and “climate change” in speeches. 
          We are committed to appearing to care about environmental issues, and unlike the major national parties, will not clutter 
          our beliefs with cumbersome policy.
      </p>
