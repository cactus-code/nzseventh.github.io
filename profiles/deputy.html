  <h1>About The Deputy Leader</h1>
  <h4>1926 - Present Day</h4>
  <p>
    Lewis Grey, was born in Windsor Castle as the next rightful king of Great Britain. During a family occasion he was 
    however mistaken for the child of Winston Churchill and an unintentional child-swap occurred. Lewis Grey 
    (despite perfect education) was forced into a Military occupation and soon had a legendary reputation in the 
    British army. His last operation as part of the British empire was a night assault on the famed “Guru Toby’s” unit. 
    It was an outstanding success and Lewis immediately retired, Guru Govin-Fowler was then reformed by Lewis and was released. 
    He then travelled around the globe until settling down as the New-Zealand unofficial chief of defence, and taking in 
    Robert Gaudin under his wing. He soon re-united with Toby Govin-Fowler (a rather popular guru at the time) and then 
    joined NZ Seventh and helped form what we know it as today.
