  <h1>About The Leader</h1>
  <h4>1935 - Present Day</h4>
  <p>
    Toby Govin-Fowler was born in India, as the illegitimate son of Ghandi. After a flawless education, Toby rose 
    up the ranks of the Indian revolutionaries before his entire regiment was captured by a British recon force led 
    by our deputy leader, Lewis Grey.
    During his years of imprisonment he wrote a book of hate of our current  “Democracy”- titled <i>On Pigment.</i> Toby 
    later was personally released by Major-General Grey, and then reformed under the ideology of the British democracy.
    He then re-wrote <i>On Pigment</i> under his new thoughts on democracy, and left Great Britain to spread the word in back in 
    India. After many years of failure in his home country: Guru Toby Govin-Fowler attempts to spread “the word” in New 
    Zealand and reunites with old friend Major-General Lewis Grey (Now New-Zealand's chief of defence).
    They united alongside Lewis’s newfound dicky chums and formed the glorious NZ Seventh party as we know it today.
