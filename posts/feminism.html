        <h2> On Feminism </h2>
        <p><i>"Equality is the opiate of the masses"</i> - Edgar Allan Poe</p>
        <p>
            As a nation, we need to reconsider whether we should really be pursuing equality of the sexes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever I say this to my moderate friends, they <i>gasp</i> with
            <i>horror</i>. "That's objectively sexist!"; "No, seriously,
            there is literally nothing defensible about that statement!";
            "You're not on the list of attendance! Trespaassers are not welcome
             - leave at once!" All these arguments are predicated on "sense",
            that curious leftist way of framing every issue as a matter of
            logic. NZ Seventh, as I'm sure you well know, believes
            passionately in nonsense - a far superior argumentative paradigm.
            Let's examine some of these issues under the lens of
            "common nonsense".
        </p>
        <h3>
            Contrived analogies - the best methodology for finding
            solutions to societal problems
        </h3>
        <p>
            Imagine there are only three people in the world, and only $190
            of capital. One of those people, and all of the money, is you.
            You employ the other two people; one of them is male, and the
            other - you guessed it - female. Let us make a concerningly
            simplistic analogy - the woman earns $70 and the man earns $100.
        </p>
        <p><i>But that's sexist! They should be payed the same!</i></p>

      <p>
          According to sense, this strawman is correct. But let's take a closer
          look. If we were to pay both individuals $100, we wouldn't have
          enough money. This leaves us with the following options:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              Continue paying them unequally - bad - a waste of the remaining
              $20.</li>
          <li>
              Give the woman the remaining $20 - bad - would be insuffucent to
              make the two equal.
          </li>
          <li>
              Give each employee $95 - bad - would require the acquisition of
              5-dollar bills.
          </li>
          <li>
              Give the man the remaining $20 - the only decent option.
          </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
          None of the options are perfect, but further favouring the man is only
          sane choice. Don't agree? You're probably under the influence of
          sense.
      </p>
      <h3>
          The further chauvinism behind the technical layer
      </h3>

      <p>
          You may be wondering if the case against feminism is purely one of
          convenience. It is not. The issue is multi-faceted, multi-edged,
          and multi-vectored. There is a fundamental and principal reason
          for the female sex to be disenfranchised, and it is this: The female
          sex is <i>designed</i> to be disenfranchised. Even the earliest
          fossils of primordial woman show disproportionately low wages,
          electoral inequality, and domestic abuse. There is nothing obvious
          that suggests this, but this is where nonsense comes back into play.
          We can deduce that women are inferior, simply by writing large
          tracts of text saying it is so. Why do so many people repeat the
          adage "fake it 'till you make it?" Because, with enough effort, you
          can realise that women are inferior to men without having any evidence
          to support the claim. Far from taking away from the concept, it
          empowers it, emboldens it. The issue of equality strays from nonsensical
          realism, to nonsencial intellectualism.
      </p>

      <h3>
          Where to from here? Turning back the clock on years of so-called
          "progress"
      </h3>
      <p>
          Female individuals have been consistently empowered throughout the
          20th century. It is time for it to stop. Even the most radical of
          leaders - those who advocate socailism, even - are too cowardly
          to push New Zealand back into a tailspin on chauvinism and sexism.
          NZ Seventh, through literature like this and other pieces of social
          comment, is standing up for the inalienable right of women to have
          their rights alienated. Now we're in the 21st century, we need 19th
          century thinking more than ever.
